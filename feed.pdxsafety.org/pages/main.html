			<p>This is a project by Wilson High School and Franklin students to get police officers and the community working together.</p>
			<p>The police puts out alerts, which you can view by:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Clicking the menu button or swipe to get to the menu</li>
					<li>Clicking on districts</li>
					<li>Clicking on the districts you want alerts from</li>
					<li>Going back to the menu and clicking "Alerts"</li>
				</ol>
			<p>If you want to see all the Alerts, unset/don't set a neighborhood. If you wish to set the alert type, you may also do that. The default is every type, so just click to unselect any of the three types (Crime, PSA, BOLO).</p>
