		<h2> APP OVERVIEW </h2>
		<p>
			This Portland Safety App will allow you to update the community on what is happening in their neighborhood. There are three different categories of alerts you can send out:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Crime
				<p>
					A crime alert would be used for any crime in which the person is not arrested. People would be advised to call 911 if they had any information.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>BOLO
				<p>
					A BOLO alert could be used any time you want to locate or identify a person. If you have a missing person you could say "Be on the look out for a..." and provide the community with a description of the person or their car. The community would then be advised to call the police non-emergency line if they saw this person.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>PSA
				<p>
					A PSA alert could be used to notify the community of a crime in their neighborhood that led to an arrest or anything that does not fall into the above categories and does not ask the public to do anything.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Another feature in the app is the ability to modify BOLO's. If you respond to a BOLO, you don't want to get a call later for the same BOLO. So just make sure the click the BOLO menu item in the top right, search by hand or search by the BOLO's case number, and remove it from the active list.
		</p>
		<h2> APP WALKTHROUGH </h2>	
		<p>
			First identify which district you are in. Click the corresponding precinct and then locate your district number from the dropdown menu. When you click the district number you will be automatically sent to the next page, but you can always go back by clicking the "Previous" button in the top left. Next, input a title for the alert you are making, and then add a longer description of the alert in the next text field. Finally select a type of alert "Crime", "PSA", or "BOLO". When you click one of the alert types you will be automatically taken to the last screen where you can see a preview of the information you just entered. Once again, if you made a mistake and want to go back just click to "Previous" button to change your entry. <b> IMPORTANT! On the preview page, if you are creating a BOLO, make sure to enter the case number in the specified text field. </b>
